The main idea for this project is wire-less water level controller, in market we can see that many waterlevel controllers but these are wired,

for example i want to install a water level controller at my building, but in building we have six floors, if we want to install we need a wire for six floor. so i want to elimanated this wire part and make it as wireless.
